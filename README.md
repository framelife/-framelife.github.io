# Project Description

This game is based on the idea of FC game Circus Charlie and implemented using WebGL.
The advanced features used in this game are the collision and normal mapping.
In this game created, Charlie needs to be controlled to dodge the ball with spike and jump through fire circles to earn score. 
The control function offers to the player is jump and move. 
The game provides Charlie with two-life which means if Charlie collides the fire circle, one- life will be deducted and also if Charlie touches with the obstacles, two-life will be deducted. When two-life are deducted, the game will over and lead to the ending frame with failure reason. 
When Charlie successfully passes a fire circle, one score will be counted and the total score will be shown at the ending frame when player loses all the two-life.
